<p>I am tired.</p>
<font color="white">
<p>I'm fairly certain I was incorrect in judging our relationship, however i needed to leave in order to become myself.</p>
<p>You see.... I loved you, no, I was obsessed with you, and it was extremely unhealthy for me.</p>
<p>...I dont think I wouldve become the person I am today without you.</p>
<p>Our relationship wasnt healthy. for either of us, but it was also exactly, at least what I needed.</p>

<p>I still have all the notes and drawings you gave to me.</p>

    <p>i do not ask for forgiveness, or to return to friendship. I ended my chance at that a long time ago.
    I apologize deeply from the absolute pits of what remains of my soul. I hope you are well, and maybe, just maybe.
    we can meet again in the distant future, and talk about how our lives were.</p>
